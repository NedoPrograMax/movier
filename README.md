If you are a TV shows lover, you should totaly appreciate the "wathing now" list, where you can save the episode you stopped at, so you don't forget it.

And Yes, there are other users too. I am very secure about it, so before using the app you have to register a new account(or login in the existing one)

After that, you can customize your account(name and profile image)

So I'm hoping you're gonna love it.
